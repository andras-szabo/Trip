o collision detection w/ background tiles
	o go thru "GetTileByPixel" and comment it so it's clear what / how it does
	o detect collisions
	o calculate valid out-of-wall projection, use that to move

o jumping & gravity
	o well, how to do jumping?, the simplest way?
	o so long as some button is pressed, set vertical velocity
	  to some value
	o then, keep track of ground / air state
	o then, if in the air, allow upwards acceleration for some
	  time (but perhaps dissipating acceleration)
	o after jump time is over, and in the air, apply gravity

o set up git repo
o push it to GitHub
o create readme
o set up main.asm
	o initialize screen and stuff
	o define tiles:
		o 0: empty tile
		o 1: full with color 1
		o 2: full with color 2
		o 3: full with color 3
	
	o define tilemap, but procedurally:
		o top row, bottom row, edges on the
		  first screen should all have tile 1,
		  otherwise empty.

o add a 2x1 sprite (2 rows, 1 col)
o move it around using subpixel velocity; horizontally
